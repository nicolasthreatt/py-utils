Program Description
    - Implementing a process pool to perform a parallel application
    - Creating a pool of four processes
    - Using the pool's map method to perform a simple calculation

Pool Class Methods
    - apply()
        + Blocks until the result is ready
    - apply_async()
        + Asynchronous operation that will not lock the main thread until all the child classes are executed
    - map()
        + Blocks until the result is ready
        + Chops the iterable data in a number of chunks that submits to the process pool as separate tasks
    - map_async
        + Variant of the map() method, which returns a result object
