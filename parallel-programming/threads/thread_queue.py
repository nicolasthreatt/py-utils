Program Description
    - Using the threading module with the queue module

Queues
    - Threading can be complicated when threads need to share data or resources
    - The Python threading module provides many synchronization primitives
    - It is considered a best practice to instead concentrate on using the module queue
    - Queues are much easier to deal with
    - They make threaded programming considerably safer
    - Queue Methods
        + put()
            -> This puts an item in the queue
        + get()
            -> This removes and returns an item from the queue
        + task_done()
            -> This needs to be called each time an item has been processed
        + join()
            -> This blocks until all items have been processed
    - Possibilities
        + If optional args block is true and timeout is None - Block until a free slot is available
        + If the block is false - Put an item in the queue if a free slot is immediately available or raise the full exception
