Parallel Computing Memory Architecture
    - Computer systems are classified into four categories
        + Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)
            - Operations executed by CPU
                -> Fetch: Fetches the data and instructions from a memory area called register
                -> Decode: The CPU decodes the instructions
                -> Execute: The instruction is carried out on the data and the results of the operation is stored in another register
            - Instructions are processed sequentially
            - Main Elements of SISD Architecture
                -> Central Memory Unit
                -> CPU
                -> The I/O System
        + Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
            - A SIMD computer consists of 'n' identical procressors, each with its own local memory, where its possible to store data
            - The procressors work simultaneously on each step and execute the same instruction, but on different data elements
            - The algorithms for these computers are relatively easy to design, analyze, and implement
            - Connection Machine (1985 Thinking Machine) and MPP (NASA - 1983)
        + Multiple Instructions Single Data (MISD)
            - Similar to SISD
            - n procressors share a single memory unit
        + Multiple Instructions Multiple Data (MIMD)
            - Similar to SIMD
            - 'n' processors in instruction steams and 'n' data streams
            - Each processors has its own control unit and local memory
            - Each processors operates under the control of a flow of instructions issued by its own control unit
            - Processors can run different programs on different data which means processes run asynchronously
            - Implementation of threads and processes

Memory Organization
    - Intro:
        + Memory Organization is the way which the data is accessed
        + The main problem: Making the response time of the memory compatible with the speed of the processor
        + When the processor starts transferring data, the memory will remain occupied for the entire time of the memory cycle
    - Shared vs. Distributed Memory
        + Shared Memory
            -> The 'i' index is a global address and the memory location 'i' is the same for each processor
            -> Features
                * Memory is the same for all processors
                * The synchronization is made possible by control the access of processors to the shared memory
                * A shared memory location must not be changed
                * Sharing data is fast
            -> Memory Access Types
                * Uniform memory access (UMA)
                * Non-Uniform memory access (NUMA)
                * No remote memory access (NORMA)
                * Cache only memory acces (COMA)
        + Distributed Memory
            -> 'i' is a local address
            -> Features
                * Memory is physically distributed between processors
                * Synchronization is achieved by moving data between processors
                * The subdivision of data in the local memories affects the performance of the machine
                * The message-passing protocol is used
            -> Advantages
                * No conflicts at the level of the communication bus or switch
                * No instrinsic limit to the number of processors
                * There are no problems of cache coherency
            -> Disadvantages
                * The communication between processors is more difficult to implement
                * If a processor requires data in the memory of another processor, the two processors should necessarily exchange
                  messages via the message-passing protocol
                * To bukd and send a message from one processor to another takes time
                * Any processor should be stopped in order to mamage the messages received from other processors
                * A program is designed to work on a distributed memory system must be organized

Parallel Programming Models
    - Shared Memory Model
        + Tasks share a single shared memory area
        + Mechanisms allow the programmer to control the access to the shared memory
        + Advantage:
            -> Programmer does not have to clarify the communication between tasks
        + Disadvantage:
            -> It becomes more difficult to understand and manage data locality
        + Keeping data local to the processor that works on it conserves memory accesses, cache, refreshes, and bus traffic
    - Multithread Model
        + A process can have multiple flows of execution
        + Used on shared memory architectures
        + The current generation CPUs are multithreaded in software and hardware
        + The Intel Hyper-threading technology implements multithreading on hardware
        + Parallelism can be achieved from this model
    - Distributed Memory Message Passing Model
        + Applied in the case where each processor has its own memory (distributed memory systems)
        + Requires the use of (ad hoc) software libaries to be used within the code
        + The MPI model is designed clearly with distributed memory
    - Data Parallel Model
        + More tasks operate on the same data structure, but each task operates on a different portion of data
        + To implement this model, a programmer must develop a program that specifies the distribution and alignment of data
        + The current generation GPUs operates high throughout with the data aligned

Designing a Parallel Program
    - Task Decomposition
        + Software program is split into tasks or set of instructions to implement parallelism
            -> Domain Decomposition
                * The data of the problems is decomposed
            -> Functional Decomposition
                * The problem is split into task
    - Task Assignment
        + Mechanism by whic hthe task will be distributed among the various processes is specified
        + It establishes the distribution of workload among the various processors
        + The programmer takes into account the possible heterogeneity of the system
        + For greater efficiency of parallelization, it is necessary to limit communication
    - Agglomeration
        + The process of combining smaller tasks with larger ones in order to improve performance
        + Tasks have to be communicated to the processor or thread
        + Most communication has costs that are not only proportional with the amount of data transferred, but also incur a fixed cost
          for every communcation operation
        + If the tasks are too small, this fixed cost can easily make the design inefficient
    - Mapping
        + In the mapping stage of the parallel algorithm design process, we specify where each task is to be executed
        + The goal is to minimize the total execution time
        + You can often make tradeoffs, as the two main strategies often conflict with each other which are:
            1. The tasks that communicate frequently should be placed in the same processor to increase locality
            2. The taks that can be executed concurrently should be placed in different processors to enhance concurrently
        + No polynomial time solutions to the problem in the general case exist
        + For tasks of equal size and tasks with easily identified communication patters, the mapping is straightforward
        + Load balancing algorithms - Identify agglomeration and mapping strategies during runtime
        + Dynamic load balancing algorithms - Run periodically during the execution
    - Dynamic Mapping
        + Global algorithms require global knowledge of the computation being performed which often adds a lot of overhead
        + Local algorithms rely only on information that is local to the task in question, which reduces overhead
        + A task-scheduling algorithm is often used that simply maps tasks to processors as they become idle
        + Taks are placed in task pool and are taken from it by workers 
        + Thee Common Approaches
            1. Manager/Worker
                -> Basic dynamic mapping scheme in which all the owrkers connect to a centralized Manager
            2. Hierachial Manager/Worker:
                -> Variant of a manager/worker that has a semi-distributed layout; workers are split into groups, each with their own manager
            3. Decentralize
                -> Each processor maintains its own task pool and communicates with the other processors in order to request tasks

Working with Processes in Python
    - What is a Process?
        + It is an executing instance of an application
        + A process can consist of multiple parallel threads
        + Starting the browser, the operating system creates a process and begins executing the primary threads of that process
    - Python Programming with Processes
        + On commin operating systems, each program runs in its own process
        + A process has its own space address, data stack, and other auxiliary data to keep track of the execution
        + The OS manages the execution of all processes

Working with Threds in Python
    - What is a Thread?
        + A thread is an active flow of control that can be activated in parallel with other threads within the same process
        + Each thread can execute a set of instructions independently and in parallel with other processes or threads
        + They share space addressing and then the data structures
        + A thread is sometimes called a lighweight process
        + The plementation of a thread is less onerous than that of a real process
    - Python Programming with Threads
        + Thread-based parallelism is the standard way of writing parallel programs
        + The Python interpreter is not fully thread-safe
        + In order to support multithreaded Python programs, a global lock called the Global interpreter Lock (GIL) is used
        + Only one thread can execute the Python code at the same time
        + Python automatically switches to the next thread after a short period of time
        + In multiple threads attempt to access the same data object, it may end up in an inconsistent state

Process vs. Threads
    - A process can consist of multiple parallel threads
    - The creation and management of a thread by the operating system is less expensive in term of CPU's resources than the creation and
      management of a process
    - Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more heavyweight tasks
    - The threads of the same process share the address space and other resources, while processes are independent of each other
